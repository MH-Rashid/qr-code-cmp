## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- How to center an object vertically on the page (various ways)
- Clean ways of constructing a footer that stays on the bottom of the page


### Continued development

- Using flexbox and CSS grid in more creative ways, e.g. to centre content on the page, not just inside objects.
- Thinking outside the box to come up with efficient and effective solutions to coding problems
- Writing concise, clean CSS
